  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Durham, studying for a PhD within the Centre for Particle Theory. My supervisors are Professors Mohamed Anber and Iñaki García-Etxebarria.
  I completed my MSc in Particles, Strings and Cosmology and my undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences (Mathematics and Computer Science) also at the University of Durham. My full CV can be found <a href="Academic_CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>

  <p>My MSc Thesis was titled 'Generalised Symmetry and Geometric Engineering', supervised by Professor Iñaki García-Etxebarria. My undergraduate thesis was titled <a href="Project_IV_Report_Final.pdf">'Special Holonomy Manifolds in String Theory and M-Theory Reductions'</a>, supervised by Professors A.P. Braun and A. Donos.</p>
  
  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Generalised Symmetry in Quantum Field Theories</li>
    <li>Geometric Engineering of Quantum Field Theories from String Theory and M-Theory</li>
    <li>Formal and Mathematical Aspects of Quantum Field Theories, String Theory and M-Theory</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>2023 Future Mathematicican International Summer Camp held at USTC in Hefei, China, funded
by a USTC Fellowship. I gave a <a href="https://www.koushare.com/video/videoPreview/2307.2164">talk</a> on Calabi-Yau manifolds, targeted at an undergraduate level. Excuse any over-simplifications!</li>
  <li>2022 Summer Project at Durham University on Cohomology of Calabi-Yau Manifolds, supervised by Professor A.P. Braun</li>
  <li>2021 Quantum Technologies Summer School at University College, London (UCL)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Teaching</h2>
