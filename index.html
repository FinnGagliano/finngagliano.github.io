  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Durham, studying for a PhD within the Centre for Particle Theory. My supervisors are Professors Mohamed Anber and Iñaki García-Etxebarria.</p>

  <p>My publications are listed on <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/2851240">my INSPIRE page.</a> See also <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/finn-gagliano/">my university page.</a> My full CV can be found <a href="Academic_CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I completed my MSc in Particles, Strings and Cosmology and my undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences (Mathematics and Computer Science) also at the University of Durham.</p>

  <p>My MSc Thesis was titled <a href="MSc Thesis.pdf">'Generalised Symmetry and Geometric Engineering'</a>, supervised by Professor Iñaki García-Etxebarria. My undergraduate thesis was titled <a href="Project_IV_Report_Final.pdf">'Special Holonomy Manifolds in String Theory and M-Theory Reductions'</a>, supervised by Professors A.P. Braun and A. Donos.</p>
