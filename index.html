  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Durham, studying for an MSc in Particles, Strings and Cosmology within the Centre for Particle Theory.
  Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate MSc in Mathematics and Computer Science also at the University of Durham. My full CV can be found <a href="Academic_CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>My main interests lie in geometrical perspectives of string theory and M-theory, but I also enjoy geometry independently:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calabi-Yau Manifolds in String Theory</li>
    <li>G<sub>2</sub> Manifolds in M-Theory</li>
    <li>Sasaki-Einstein Manifolds in the AdS/CFT Correspondence</li>    
  </ul>
