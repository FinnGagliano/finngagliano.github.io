  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Durham, studying for an MSc in Particles, Strings and Cosmology within the Centre for Particle Theory.
  Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate MSc in Natural Sciences (Mathematics and Computer Science) also at the University of Durham. My undergraduate thesis was titled <a href="Project_IV_Report_Final.pdf">'Special Holonomy Manifolds in String Theory and M-Theory Reductions'</a>, supervised by Professors A.P. Braun and A. Donos. My full CV can be found <a href="Academic_CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>My main interests lie in geometrical perspectives of string theory and M-theory, but I also enjoy geometry independently:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Special Holonomy Manifolds, particularly Calabi-Yau and G<sub>2</sub> manifolds</li>
    <li>Geometric flows, particularly the Calabi and K&auml;hler-Ricci flows</li>
    <li>String Compactifications and Dualities</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>2023 Future Mathematicican International Summer Camp held at USTC in Hefei, China, funded
by a USTC Fellowship. I gave a <a href="https://www.koushare.com/video/videoPreview/2307.2164">talk</a> on Calabi-Yau manifolds, targeted at an undergraduate level. Excuse any over-simplifications!</li>
  <li>2022 Summer Project at Durham University on Cohomology of Calabi-Yau Manifolds, supervised by Professor A.P. Braun</li>
  <li>2021 Quantum Technologies Summer School at University College, London (UCL)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Teaching Assistant for 2nd year tutorials in Theory of Computation at Durham University</li>
    <li>Zero Gravity Mentor for a female high-school student from a low-income background to support their journey to university. Now studying Mathematics at the University of Leeds.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://assets.press.princeton.edu/releases/gowers/gowers_VIII_6.pdf">Some advice that hepled me a lot.</a></li>
    <li> <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/70/5/10/835566/Commentary-Diversity-in-physics-Are-you-part-of">An important article regarding diversity in physics.</a></li>
